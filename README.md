### Description of Project
Explore the fascinating world of quantum physics with the "Chat with Quantum Physicist" project. Leveraging Hugging Face's LaMini language model, this project allows users to engage in insightful conversations with a virtual quantum physicist. The model is trained on two prominent quantum physics books, vectorized, and stored using ChromaDB for efficient retrieval.

Technologies Used:
* Hugging Face 
* LaMini model
* Langchain 
* Flask
* ChromaDB
